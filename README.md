## Welcome! ##

Welcome to our Unix Command Line Console repository! This project was created by two classmates as a way to improve our skills in C programming and Unix systems. The console offers a variety of commands for users to interact with their Unix system, including options for file manipulation, system information, and more. We hope that you find this project useful and we welcome any contributions or feedback you may have.

This project was developed over the course of a semester, with four distinct deliverables. During each deliverable, we worked hard to ensure that the console was functional and user-friendly. We received good grades on each deliverable, which encouraged us to keep improving the console.

Throughout the development of this project, we learned a lot about C programming and Unix systems. We are proud of the final product and hope that it will be useful for other users.

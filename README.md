## Welcome! ##

This is our Unix Command Line Console repository! This project was created by two classmates as a way to improve our skills in C programming and Unix systems. The console offers a variety of commands for users to interact with their Unix system, including options for file manipulation, system information, and more. We hope that you find this project useful and we welcome any contributions or feedback you may have.

The project was developed over the course of a semester, with four distinct deliverables. During each deliverable, we worked hard to ensure that the console was functional and user-friendly. We received good grades on each deliverable, which encouraged us to keep improving it.

Throughout the development of this project, we learned a lot about C programming and Unix systems. We are proud of the final product and hope that it will be useful for other users.

## Deliverables ##

### D0 ###
The first deliverable of this project focused on implementing basic commands and a command history for the console. The command history allowed users to view and access previously entered commands. These features formed the foundation of the console and were essential for its functionality.

### D1 ###
The second deliverable of this project focused on improving the functionality of the console by adding commands for managing directories and files.
'''
create: creates files or directories
stat: gives information on files or directories
list: lists directories contents
delete: deletes files and/or empty directories
deltree: deletes files and/pr non empty directories recursively
'''


## Linked List ##

One of the tools that we used in the development of this project was a linked list with a head node. A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is stored in a node, and each node points to the next node in the list. A head node is a special node that marks the beginning of the linked list.

We used a linked list with a head node to store and manage the various tasks that the console needed to perform. For example, we used a linked list to keep track of the available commands, as well as to store the command history for the console.

The use of a linked list allowed us to easily add, remove, and access elements in the list, as well as to keep track of the size of the list. It also allowed us to implement advanced features such as piping and redirection, which required the ability to manipulate the list in real-time.

Overall, the use of a linked list with a head node was an important part of the development of the console, and contributed to its functionality and efficiency.
